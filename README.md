Extreme poverty is defined as an International Wealth Index (IWI) score below 30. IWI is an asset-based wealth index used to measure poverty in the developing world. It is based on data for over 2.1 million househols in 97 developing countries. IWI scores run from 0-100 — 0 represents households with none of the measured assets – including consumer durables, safe housing, and access to basic services — and 100 represents households with all of the measured assets. Any score below 70 meets the criteria for poverty.
